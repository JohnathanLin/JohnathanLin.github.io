# Welcome
Hello and welcome to WindyPath. I am the owner of this website. My English name is Johnathan.

My Chinese nickname is "凌虚" which comes from a Chinese animated film called *The Legend of Qin*. "凌虚" is the name of a sword that belong to Zhang Liang(张良), a famous strategist in the Warring Period. The name of this website is *WindyPath*, and its Chinese name is "风萧古道".

The first two characters, "风萧" come from poetry "风萧萧兮易水寒" while the last two characters, "古道" are derived from poetry "古道西风瘦马".


# About Me
I work as a Game Server Engineer and I have previously developed website, including both frontend and backend. However, I no longer develop websites.

I graduated from university in 2019, and I moved to ShangHai in December 2020. 

You can read more about my computer story [HERE](../posts/individual_project_experience).

# My Idealism
For a long time, I didn't know what to study software development for. I have earned some money in these years, but I wanted to move forward in my career of software development. I am interested in developing Chinese software.

# My Articles
I do not update my blog frequently, but I do browse articles on other blogs. I have noticed that some blogs have many articles that are little more than complaints or notes. These types of articles do not effectively improve software development.

On my blog, I only publish **technology articles**. Even if I feel compelled to complain about something, I always try to tie it back to a software development concept so that visitors can learn something from it.

I post other daily life observations and complaints on my Twitter account.
