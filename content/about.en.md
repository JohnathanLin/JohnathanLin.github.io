Born in the mid-1990s, male, from FJNU (Fujian Normal University), a native of Xiamen, Fujian, currently residing in Shanghai.

As a child, I always lost in computer games. Suddenly, I became interested in web pages. I would randomly modify saved web pages and open them to see the text change. It was incredibly exciting. In order to have unlimited time using computers, I decisively applied for a major in computer science.

Never did I imagine that I would end up working as a game server developer. Two and a half years have passed in the project team of "Game of Thrones: Winter is Coming" Asia-Pacific version. I independently maintained the server for as long as half a year, becoming the "Guardian of the North Kingdom."

Here, I document the process of my step-by-step growth.
