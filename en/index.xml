      <description>Preface During a coding interview, I encountered a question that involved two lines of input. Each line contained an unknown number of numbers separated by spaces. The input format was as follows:
12 34 567 888 99 100 358 74 58454 742 4469 88 They did not provide the number of digits in each line in advance. Instead, they required the user to split them themselves.
During the coding exam, I didn&amp;rsquo;t implement this functionality using C++, but instead used the split() method available in Java to handle it.</description>

      <description>This article primarily introduces the basics of Linux C++ Socket network programming. Most of the knowledge is sourced from the website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/
Socket Programming State Diagram From the diagram, we can see that the server side needs to go through four steps to enter the &amp;ldquo;waiting for connection&amp;rdquo; state, while the client side only requires two.
Brief Analysis of Socket Programming Functions This analysis is for personal understanding and may have some omissions.</description>

      <description>Born in the mid-1990s, male, from FJNU (Fujian Normal University), a native of Xiamen, Fujian, currently residing in Shanghai.
As a child, I always lost in computer games. Suddenly, I became interested in web pages. I would randomly modify saved web pages and open them to see the text change. It was incredibly exciting. In order to have unlimited time using computers, I decisively applied for a major in computer science.</description>
