      <description>Preface During a coding interview, I encountered a question that involved two lines of input. Each line contained an unknown number of numbers separated by spaces. The input format was as follows:
12 34 567 888 99 100 358 74 58454 742 4469 88 They did not provide the number of digits in each line in advance. Instead, they required the user to split them themselves.
During the coding exam, I didn&amp;rsquo;t implement this functionality using C++, but instead used the split() method available in Java to handle it.</description>

      <description>Born in the mid-1990s, male, from FJNU (Fujian Normal University), a native of Xiamen, Fujian, currently residing in Shanghai.
As a child, I always lost in computer games. Suddenly, I became interested in web pages. I would randomly modify saved web pages and open them to see the text change. It was incredibly exciting. In order to have unlimited time using computers, I decisively applied for a major in computer science.</description>
